NameTune Generator

NameTune Generator is a small program that creates a short melodic tune based on a given name.
Each name produces a unique sequence of musical notes using a simple algorithmic composition technique.
The generated tune is saved as a .wav file and automatically played on a webpage.

How It Works

The user’s name (or any string) is converted into numeric values.

These values are mapped to musical notes and durations.

The program generates a .wav audio file from the resulting note sequence.

The HTML frontend automatically loads and plays the .wav file in the browser.

Each name → one unique melody.
Same name → same tune every time.
